Must compile for now, will create a tap soon

## About

**Bluesnooze prevents your sleeping Mac from connecting to Bluetooth accessories.**

If you pair Bluetooth headphones or speakers with both your phone & Mac it can be frustrating when your sleeping Mac connects intermittently and disrupts the audio.

With Bluesnooze the Bluetooth connection is switched off when your Mac sleeps, and switched on when your Mac wakes.

## Caveats

- Please note this app is not compatible with the “Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac” feature.
- Unfortunately this app can't be distributed via the App Store because it uses a private API to switch Bluetooth on/off (but the release version is notarized by Apple).
